# FirstAid
First Aid Android App used to guide first respondents at the scene of an incident

The First Aid App aims to assist users in performing to the best of their ability during first aid incidents: by having a guide to reference and follow; helping them to stay calm. Further features are implemented to assist in this process, such as a quick dial to emergency services and display of the userâ€™s current location.

While using the First Aid app, users complete a guide by answering questions and following directions on screen. Data from these answers are stored in a report. This means that incident data and records are automatically created on scene of an incident with the use of the First Aid App, saving the responder time and keeping data precise.

MVC, observer pattern, an SQLite database, speech to text and other features were included for a fully functioning application.
